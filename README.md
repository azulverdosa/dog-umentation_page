## General Information

---

This project was to build a single page website that was a documentation page. I got a little creative and focused more on the topic for documentiation that I probably should have. This project was part of the [Free Code Camp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/) coding basics courses and was one of the first projects I ever built.

## Setup

---

### Dependencies

- React
- React-Dom

### Run Locally

1. Clone repo locally
2. Run `npm install` in your bash/command line
3. Run `npm start` in your bash/command line
4. Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

### Available Commands

In the project directory, you can run:

`"npm start" : "react-scripts start"`,

The app is built using `create-react-app` so this command Runs the app in Development mode. Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

<!-- ### `"npm run dev": "concurrently "nodemon server" "npm run start"`,

For running the server and app together I am using concurrently this helps a lot in the MERN application as it runs both the server (client and server) concurrently. So you can work on them both together. -->

## Usage

---

At the moment there is no real functionality to the page, simple a place to view some silly documentation on how to be a dog, however I am going to try to think of some functionality I can try to add to it.

## Project Status

---

Project is: Complete

## Room for Improvement

---

This project is over a year old now and having learned a few more things I'm re-visiting it to add some upgrades. I have already added a backend API to start but will need to add functionality as well.

Improvement Thoughts:

- Improve layout for better viewing
- Give functionality
- Create a SPA using React

To do:

- [x] Add React components
