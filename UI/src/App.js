            Some of us are better or more obvious when we find a smell we like, you might see those

          <p>Either approach is fine, what you want to avoid is:</p>

            (we'll take treats without needing the words) we should remember how cute it is that
            they do this and humour them. Here are the words you might here and what they meant for
            you to do:
          </p>
          <code>
            {`const stay = "don't chase anything"`} <br />

          <header>If cat... Statements</header>
          <p>
            Cats. There is nothing that clouds our judgement more then a smug cat. There is only one
            way to know if it's safe to act on those urges and we have documented those instructions
            here:
          </p>
          <p class="rule">
            Use the if cat statement to execute an action if the logical condition is true. Use
            restraint to not execute the cat if the condition is false. If cat statements break down
            as follows:
          </p>
          <code>
            {`if (condition) {`}
            <br />
            {`statement_1;`} <br />
            {` } else { `} <br />
            {`statement_2;`}
            <br />
            {` }`}
          </code>

          <p>
            You may also compound the statements using else if to have multiple conditions tested in
            sequence, as follows:
          </p>
          <code>
            {`if (condition_1) { `} <br />
            {`statement_1; `} <br />
            {`} else if (condition_2) { `} <br />
            {`statement_2;`} <br />
            {`} else if (condition_n) { `} <br />
            {`statement_n; `} <br />
            {`} else { statement_last; }`}
          </code>

          <p>Here are some examples of these statements.</p>
          <code>
            {`if (cat is sleeping) {stay;}`}
            <br />
            <br />
            {`if (cat is staring_at_you) {`} <br />
            {`chase;`}
            <br />
            {`} else {`} <br />
            {`stay;`} <br />
            {`}`} <br />
            <br />
            {`if (cat is spraying_in_your_backyard) {chase;} `}
            <br />
            <br />
            {`if (cat is cleaning_it's_wiskars) {chase}`} <br />
            <br />
            {`if (cat is licking_it's_butt) {`} <br />
            {`stay;`} <br />
            {`} else if (cat is just_stretching) {`} <br />
